# runlmc

Do you like to apply Bayesian nonparameteric methods to your regressions? Are you frequently tempted by the flexibility that kernel-based learning provides? Do you have trouble getting structured kernel interpolation or various training conditional inducing point approaches to work in a non-stationary multi-output setting?

If so, this package is for you.

**runlmc** is a Python 3.5+ package designed to extend structural efficiencies from _Scalable inference for structured Gaussian process models_ (Staa√ßi 2012) and _Thoughts on Massively Scalable Gaussian Processes_ (Wilson et al 2015) to the non-stationary setting of linearly coregionalized multiple-output regressions. For the single output setting, MATLAB implementations are available [here](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/).

In other words, this provides a matrix-free implementation of multi-output GPs for certain covariances. As far as I know, this is also the only matrix-free implementation for single-output GPs in python.

## Usage Notes

* Zero-mean only for now.
* Check out the [latest documentation](http://runlmc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Check out the *Dev Stuff* section below for installation requirements.
* Accepts arbitrary input dimensions are allowed, but the number of active dimensions in each kernel must still be capped at two (though a model can have multiple different kernels depending on different subsets of the dimensions).

You should be able to directly use `runlmc` with minimal requirements by running:

```
! pip install git+https://github.com/vlad17/runlmc.git@master
```

If you found `runlmc` useful, **please cite the original paper. I spend my own free time maintaining the code so this would really be appreciated:

## A note on GPy

[GPy](https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy) is a way more general GP library that was a strong influence in the development of this one. I've tried to stay as faithful as possible to its structure.

I've re-used a lot of the GPy code. The main issue with simply adding my methods to GPy is that the API used to interact between GPy's `kern`, `likelihood`, and `inference` packages centers around the `dL_dK` object, a matrix derivative of the likelihood with respect to covariance. The materialization of this matrix is the very thing my algorithm tries to avoid for performance.

If there is some quantifiable success with this approach then integration with GPy would be a reasonable next-step.

## Examples and Benchmarks

### Snippet

    n_per_output = [65, 100]
    xss = list(map(np.random.rand, n_per_output))
    yss = [f(2 * np.pi * xs) + np.random.randn(len(xs)) * 0.05
           for f, xs in zip([np.sin, np.cos], xss)]
    ks = [RBF(name='rbf{}'.format(i)) for i in range(nout)]
    ranks = [1]
    fk = FunctionalKernel(D=len(xss), lmc_kernels=ks, lmc_ranks=ranks)
    lmc = LMC(xss, yss, functional_kernel=fk)
    # ... plotting code
        
![unopt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlad17/runlmc/master/examples/unopt.png)

    lmc.optimize()
    # ... more plotting code
    
![opt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vlad17/runlmc/master/examples/opt.png)

### Running the Examples and Benchmarks

Make sure that the directory root is in the `PYTHONPATH` when running the benchmarks. E.g., from the directory root:

    PYTHONPATH=.. jupyter notebook examples/example.ipynb
    cd benchmarks/fx2007 && ./run.sh # will take a while!
    
## Dev Stuff

All below invocations should be done from the repo root.

| Command           | Purpose  |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| `./style.sh`      | Check style with pylint, ignoring TODOs and locally-disabled warnings. |
| `./docbuild.sh`   | Regenerate docs (index will be in `doc/_generated/_build/index.html`) |
| `nosetests`       | Run unit tests |
| `./arxiv-tar.sh`       | Create an arxiv-friendly tarball of the paper sources |
| `python setup.py install`       | Install minimal runtime requirements for `runlmc` |
| `./asvrun.sh` | run performance benchmarks |

To develop, requirements also include:

    sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme matplotlib codecov pylint parameterized pandas contexttimer GPy asv

To build the paper, the packages `epstool` and `epstopdf` are required. Developers should also have `sphinx sphinx_rtd_theme matplotlib GPy codecov pylint parameterized pandas contexttimer` installed.

### Roadmap

0. Make `standard_tester` stale-tolerable: can't fetch data, code from `github` without version inconsistency.
0. Make `grad-grid` benchmark only generate `pdf` files directly, get rid of `epstool,epstopdf` deps.
0. Make all benchmarks accept --validate (And add --validate test for representation-cmp : inv path should be tested in `bench.py`)
0. Automatically trigger ./asvrun.sh on commit, somehow
0. Automatically find `min_grad_ratio` parameter / get rid of it.
    * Logdet approximations: (1) [Chebyshev-Hutchinson](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06394) [Code](https://sites.google.com/site/mijirim/logdet) (2) [Integral Probing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02661) (3) [Lanczos](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~saad/PDF/ys-2016-04.pdf) (4) approx `tr log (A)` with MVM from [f(A)b](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/090778250) paper
0. Preconditioning
    * Cache Krylov solutions over iterations?
    * Cutajar 2016 iterative inversion approach?
    * T.Chan preconditioning for specialized on-grid case (needs development of partial grid)
0. TODO(test) - document everything that's missing documentation along the way.
0. Current prediction generates the full covariance matrix, then throws everything but the diagonal away. Can we do better?
0. Compare to [MTGP](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~davidc/publications_MTGP.php), [CGP](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume12/alvarez11a/alvarez11a.pdf)
0. Minor perf improvements: what helps?
    * CPython; numba.
    * In-place multiplication where possible
    * square matrix optimizations
    * TODO(sparse-derivatives)
    * bicubic interpolation: invert order of xs/ys for locality gains (i.e., interpolate
      x first then y)
0. TODO(sum-fast) low-rank dense multiplications give SumKernel speedups?
0. multidimensional inputs and ARD.
0. TODO(prior). Compare to [spike and slab](http://www.aueb.gr/users/mtitsias/publications.html), also try MedGP (e.g., three-parameter beta) - add tests for priored versions of classes, some tests in parameterization/ (priors should be value-cached, try to use an external package)
0. HalfLaplace should be a Prior, add vectorized priors (remembering the shape)
0. Migrate to asv, separate tests/ folder (then no autodoc hack to skip test_* modules; pure-python benchmarks enable validation of weather/ and fx2007 benchmarks on travis-ci but then need to be decoupled from MATLAB implementations)
0. mean functions
0. product kernels (multiple factors) 
0. active dimension optimization
0. Consider other approximate inverse algorithms: see Thm 2.4 of [Agarwal, Allen-Zhu, Bullins, Hazan, Ma 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01146)
